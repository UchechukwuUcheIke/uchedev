### Maverick Hunter X: Reviving a Classic for a New Generation

The year is 21XX. Humans and reploids—robots with complete free will—live in relative harmony on Earth. The peace is tenuous, however, as some reploids misuse their free will, turning rogue against humanity and earning the label "Maverick." To combat this threat, a police force known as the Maverick Hunters is formed under the leadership of Commander Sigma. This conflict comes to a head once Commander Sigma turns Maverick and leads an all-out assault against humanity, leaving our protagonists, Maverick Hunters X and Zero to defeat Sigma and quash his Maverick insurrection.

#### This sounds familiar...

That's because it is! Maverick Hunter is a retelling of the events of the Megaman X and Zero series developed on the Roblox Studio game engine, with enhanced graphics, gameplay, and a greater emphasis on story and character development. While Maverick Hunter X is set to be a faithful remake of the beloved Megaman X franchise, it will not shy away from much-needed updates to the formula including online multiplayer, modern cutscenes, and voice acting.

#### Why Roblox Studio?

Megaman X has been my favorite game franchise since I discovered it at the age of 12. The games have given me an unparalleled amount of enjoyment playing through their levels, defeating their bosses, and piecing together their lore. My objective with Maverick Hunter X is to share that experience with as many youth as possible. Roblox is the perfect platform for Maverick Hunter X because it hosts a bustling community of 70 million daily users, many of whom are gaming for the first time. By developing Maverick Hunter on the Roblox platform, I can reach a wide audience and share the joy of one of gaming's most iconic franchises with the new generation.

#### What's development looking like?

Maverick Hunter X does not have an official release date as of yet. I will look to post development updates on the game to this website as they are ready.
